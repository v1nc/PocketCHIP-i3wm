# PocketCHIP-i3wm
A guide for i3wm on the PocketCHIP, partially based on [this](https://github.com/justinwash/PocketCHIP-i3wm).
This was made for debian 9 but can also work on other versions.

1. Install i3 and PocketDESK:
```
sudo apt get-update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install i3 i3blocks git
git clone https://github.com/AllGray/PocketDesk.git
sudo ./PocketDesk/PocketDESK.sh
```

2. Clone this repo and copy files, you can also copy them manually. __It is important to do this before you reboot, because your PocketCHIP probably wont boot successfully without the xorg config!__
```
git clone https://github.com/v1nc/PocketCHIP-i3wm
sudo cp -R PocketCHIP-i3wm/* /
```
3. Set permissions for binaries:
```
sudo chmod +x /bin/battery
sudo chmod +x /bin/brightness
```

3. Reboot, select i3 at the xfce screen, login and enjoy
